Docs for dependency scanning: https://github.com/marketplace/actions/dependency-review

* `comment-summary-in-pr` doesn't seem to be supported
* Need to enable "Dependency graph" in "Code security and analysis" in the repo settings
* From the docs: "We don't have license information for all of your dependents. If we can't detect the license for a dependency we will inform you, but the action won't fail."
* It doesn't seem to output any license info by default?
